# Input

Put simply, this is just a giant wrapper for GLFW's input system, because I want the Engine to have its own api for input and the Game project shouldn't
have to directly interact with the library. It also includes some additional helper functions for MousePosition and stuff along those lines. So, I guess
its not totally just a wrapper. Anyways, not really too much to document about the input. There may eventually be controller support and what not, for that
there would need to be more defines and maybe a few more files, not sure I want to do this though.
