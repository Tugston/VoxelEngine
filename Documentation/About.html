			<h1>About My Engine</h1>

            	<h2>Overview</h2>
            	<p>This engine started out as a tutorial project following The Cherno's game engine series. I made it through about five or six videos or so before realizing I want to just make this project my own way. No fault to him, it is a great series; I just wanted something built that I could call mine, even if it turned out terrible. This engine does not really have a name, all I know is I just want it to have the capability of making a variety of voxel games. Apart from the obvious areas like the core, main application setup, Layers (which I am trying to figure out how to implement into what I have going on now), and the logger, everything is 100% mine. I am not using this about page to brag about my engine in any way, if anyone reads this use it as inspiration more than anything. If I can make a game engine, I am 1,000,000% certain you can as well!</p>

				<h2>Inspiration</h2>
				<p>I have always been interested in programming, more specifically game development. The issue is I am about as far away from an artist as one can get. I consistently used this as a crutch, never learned art, and pretty much blamed art skills on my lack of producing games. So, I jumped into the next best thing, making an engine for games. May not be the best decision ever, but I am having way more of a blast doing this than blaming my artistic endeavors. On top of this, I will 100% feel much more accomplished making a couple very tiny games built on my own engine with terrible art than making games with an existing engine.</p>
				<p>Throughout this journey I been reading Game Engine Archetecture Volume 3, Real Time Rendering, and I have a Vulcan book I have not even opened yet. So, I feel like these resources deserve a bit of a shoutout. Regardless, in the future I would definitely enjoy getting into game development with means of outsourcing everything besides programming and level design. My current situations do not allow me to do this. Maybe sometime though.</p>

				<h2>Future Endeavors</h2>
				<p>I plan on just going with the flow to be honest. I know for sure I am not going to add multiplayer capabilities or ray tracing. However, my end goal is to have a voxel engine with a usable editor, scripting, and capable of making a game from start to finish. I will add things like mesh importers and everything else. As it currently stands (2/22/2026) I still have tons to worry about in the root systems than to add these exciting features. But, that is the plan at least!</p>

				<p>Anyways, that is all I have. If you end up seeing this and have further questions, you may email me at ved.ecreiPtnecniV at gmail com. Look, its backwards I know, but have to confuse the bots scraping this somehow haha. Anyways, thanks for your interest in my project!</p>
